    "text": "A process-oriented dynamic model was developed which runs on daily time steps. Required external data inputs are the mean daily temperature [°C], precipitation [mm d-1], global radiation [W m-2], wind speed [m s-1], relative humidity [%] and values derived from these like vapour pressure [mbar] and saturation deficit [mbar]. Temperature depended processes are calculated generally using an effective temperature (Teff) [°C], which is the mean daily air temperature [°C] (Tair) minus a base temperature (Tb = 3 °C), which is the limit for growing processes in sugar beet (Milford et al., 1985).\n\\[T_{eff}  = \\left\\{\\begin{array}{2, 2}\nT_{air} - T_{b} & |~~~T&gt;0 \\\\\n0 & |~T&lt;30\n\\end{array}\\right.\\]\nThe model was implemented using an object oriented component library termed HUME (H. Kage and Stützel, 1999a) on the basis of Embarcadero® Delphi® 2010 (Embarcadero Technologies, Inc., USA). The model is comprised of submodels describing plant growth and development, soil water dynamics, and evapotranspiration.\n\n\n\n\nThe simulation of plant growth is based on an approach using light use efficiency (LUEPAR) [g MJ-1] to calculate dry matter production. Leaf area index (LAI) [m2 m-2] is thereby used to calculate the intercepted photosynthetic active radiation (Q) [MJ m-2]\n\\[Q=0.5\\cdot {{R}_{global}}\\cdot 1-{{e}^{-{{k}_{PAR}}\\cdot LAI}}\\]\nwhere Rglobal is the global radiation [MJ m-2] and kPAR the extinction-coefficient for photosynthetic active radiation [-]. kPAR is assumed to be constant (Andrieu et al., 1997). The factor 0.5 reflects the assumption that roughly 50% of the incoming global radiation is photosynthetic active radiation [MJ m-2] (Szeicz, 1974). The daily total dry matter growth rate [g m-2 d-1] is calculated by multiplying the intercepted radiation (Q) with the potenial light use efficiency for photosynthetic active radiation (LUEPAR) [g MJ-1] and stress factors for drought stress (fdroughtLUE) [-] and for temperature (ftempLUE) [-].\n\\[\\frac{dD{{M}_{total}}}{dt}=Q\\cdot LU{{E}_{par}}\\cdot {{f}_{droughtLUE}}\\cdot {{f}_{tempLUE}}\\]\nfdroughtLUE describes the reduction of dry matter production if potential transpiration (T~pot) [mm d-1] exceeds actual transpiration (T~act) [mm d-1].\n\\[{{f}_{droughtLUE}}=\\frac{{{T}_{act}}}{{{T}_{pot}}}\\]\nftempLUE describes the reduction of dry matter production due to suboptimal temperature. It follows a trapezoidal optimum function, which can be described by 4 cardinal temperatures (Tb = minimum temperature for dry matter production, T2 and T3 = lower an upper limit of the optimal temperature range, T4 = maximum temperature). The values for Tb-T4 for the calculations of ftempLUE are obtained from the literature and from experiment 1. Specification of the optimum temperatures for growth processes in sugar beet varies within the literature. Optimum temperature for leaf growth ranges between 19 °C (Milford and Riley, 1980) and 24 °C (Terry, 1968) while that for taproot growth was lower (12 °C (Milford and Riley, 1980), 17 °C (Terry, 1968) or 18 °C (Kenter et al., 2006). Vandendriessche (2000) uses in his model a temperature optimum from 10 °C to 25 °C for sugar beet assimilation. The lower limit of the temperature optimum was parameterised using the data of experiment 1 and resulted in T2 = 15.5 °C. As the upper limit of the temperature optimum is unlikely to be reflected in the experimental data a value of T3 = 25 °C was chosen to cover the mostly mentioned optimum temperatures for taproot and leaf growth. T4 as upper limit was set to 35 °C according to Vandendriessche (2000).\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A(RUEpot) -.-&gt; F\n  C(ftempLUE) -.-&gt; A\n  D(fdroughtLUE) -.-&gt; A\n  E(Q) --&gt; F{dWdt}\n  F --&gt; B[DM]\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal dry matter (DMtotal) [g m-2] in the model is partitioned into three plant components: root dry matter (DMroot) [g m-2], petiole dry matter (DMpetiole) [g m-2] and leaf dry matter (DMleaf) [g m-2]. DMroot refers to the storage root of the sugar beets.\n\\[D{{M}_{total}}=D{{M}_{root}}+D{{M}_{leaf}}+D{{M}_{petiole}}\\]\nIn the model calculation the growth rate of DMtotal is allocated to its components.\n\\[\\frac{dD{{M}_{total}}}{dt}=\\frac{dD{{M}_{root}}}{dt}+\\frac{dD{{M}_{leaf}}}{dt}+\\frac{dD{{M}_{petiole}}}{dt}\\]\nThe growth rate of DMroot is derived from the growth rate of DMtotal using an allocation coefficient f [-] which in turn is dependent on the amount of DMtotal\n\\[\\frac{dD{{M}_{root}}}{dt}=\\frac{dD{{M}_{total}}}{dt}\\cdot (f+{{f}_{a}})\\]\nwith\n\\[f={{({{f}_{a}}\\cdot \\ln (D{{M}_{total}})+{{f}_{b}})}_{{}}}\\]\nwhere fa and fb are empiric regression coefficients describing slope and intercept of a linear regression of f on DMtotal. In turn the daily growth rate of the shoot (DMshoot) can be calculated by subtracting the daily growth rate of DMroot from the daily growth rate of DMtotal and DMdead, which is the senescent dry matter of the leaves (see Eq. 16).\n\\[\\frac{dD{{M}_{shoot}}}{dt}=\\frac{dD{{M}_{total}}}{dt}-\\frac{dD{{M}_{root}}}{dt}-\\frac{dD{{M}_{dead}}}{dt}\\] To distribute the shoot dry matter into DMleaf and DMpetiole an allometric relationship between DMleaf and DMpetiole is assumed. The relative growth rates of DMleaf and DMpetiole exhibit a constant ratio leading to a linear function between the natural logarithm of both fractions (Eq. 11).\n\\[\\ln (D{{M}_{petiole}})={{f}_{la}}\\cdot \\ln (D{{M}_{leaf}})+{{f}_{lb}}\\]\nwhere fla and flb [-] are regression coefficients. fleaf can then be expressed as (H. Kage and Stützel, 1999b). The growth rates of DMleaf and DMpetiole are calculated from the growth rate of DMshoot using fleaf.\n\\[\\frac{dD{{M}_{leaf}}}{dt}={{f}_{leaf}}\\cdot \\frac{dD{{M}_{shoot}}}{dt}\\]\nand\n\\[\\frac{dD{{M}_{petiole}}}{dt}=(1-{{f}_{leaf}})\\cdot \\frac{dD{{M}_{shoot}}}{dt}\\]\n\\[{{f}_{leaf}}=\\frac{1}{1+{{e}^{{{f}_{lb}}}}\\cdot {{f}_{la}}\\cdot D{{M}_{leaf}}^{(f_{la}-1)}}\\]\nThe sugar growth rate (S) is calculated according to Qi et al. (2005) using a sugar partitioning coefficient (SPC).\n\\[\\frac{dS}{dt}=\\frac{dD{{M}_{total}}}{dt}\\cdot \\left( \\frac{SPC\\cdot D{{M}_{total}}}{1+SPC\\cdot D{{M}_{total}}} \\right)\\]\n\n\n\nTo calculate the intercepted radiation the actual LAI is needed for Eq. 2. It is calculated from DMleaf using the specific leaf area (SLA) [cm2 g-1].\n\\[LAI=\\frac{D{{M}_{leaf}}\\cdot SLA}{10000}\\]\nThe SLA is calculated depending on three factors:\n\nMean temperature over ten days (Tmean) [°C],\nMean PAR over ten days (PARmean) [MJ m-2],\nTemperature sum (TSum) [°C].\n\nTsum is the accumulated Teff over time starting from sowing. The parameters were obtained from parameterisation using data from experiment 1. (Eq. 17) The dry matter production is initialised by the calculation of the temperature depending leaf area index after emergence (LAIe) [m2 m-2]. This starts if Tsum is greater than the value of the growing degree-days needed for emergence (Tem) [°Cd]. Hoffmann and Kluge-Severin (2011) estimated 100 to 130 °Cd to be required for 50% field emergence of autumn and spring sown sugar beets, whereas Guérif and Duke (1998) reported of 80–150 °Cd. We set Tem to 130 °Cd in our model. The determining factors for the exponential early growth of LAIe are plant density (SD) [plants m-2], leaf area per plant at emergence (LAI0) [cm2 plant-1], relative growth rate of early canopy growth (RGRl) and Tsum and Tem.\n\\[LAI_e=\\frac{LAI_0 \\cdot SD^{(RGR_{l} \\cdot(T_{sum}-T_{em}))}}{10000}\\]\nThe values for the LAI0 and RGRl are used according to Guérif and Duke (1998) while LAIcrit was estimated from experiment 1. In the start phase the LAI is replaced by LAIe in Eq. 2. The use of LAIe is limited to a threshold (LAIcrit) [-]. Exceeding this threshold LAI growth is assumed to be not only temperature driven but depending on assimilate availability. Therefore for LAI &gt; LAIcrit it is calculated according to Eq. 3. To take senescence processes in the canopy into account an approach from Gabrielle et al. (1998) was used. The maximum sustainable LAI (LAIsusmax) [m2 m-2]) depending on the incoming radiation is calculated as\n\\[LAI_{susmax}=\\frac{1}{k} \\cdot log(\\frac{PAR_{mean}}{PAR_x \\cdot f_{tempLAI}})\\]\nwhere PARx is a threshold value for the radiation which is needed to maintain leaf net assimilation positive. Below this value the bottom leaves will start to become senescent. As the respiration is a process depending on temperature, PARx is modified by a temperature factor ftempLAI, which is based on a Q10 factor of 2 and a reference temperature (Tr) [°C] of 20 °C.\n\\[f_{tempLAI}=q_{10}^\\frac{T_{air}-T_r}{10}\\]\nIf LAI &gt; LAIsusmax senescence due to low radiation occurs and the daily senescence rate LAIs is calculated as\n\\[\\frac {dLAI_s}{dt}=\\,\\left\\{ \\begin{align}\n  & {LAI-LAI_{susmax} \\cdot f_{sen}}\\ \\left| {LAI} \\right.&gt; LAI_{susmax} \\\\\n& 0~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\left| {{T}_{eff}} \\right.&lt; LAI_{susmax} \\\\\n\\end{align} \\right.\\ \\]\nwhere fsen is a parameter describing the portion of LAI that is reduced each day. As a reduction in the LAI due to senescence is coupled with a reduction in DMshoot the amount of dead dry matter is calculated (DMdead) [g m-2].\n\\[DM_{dead}=\\frac {LAI_s}{SLA_{dead}} \\cdot 10000\\]\nwhere SLAdead is the SLA of the senescent leaves.\n\n\n\nThe evapotranspiration module is based on the Penman-Monteith equation (Monteith and Unsworth, 2013). This equation needs as input data global radiation [W m-2], wind speed [m s-1], saturation deficit [mbar] and daily mean temperature [°C] to calculate the potential evapotranspiration (ETpot) [mm d-1]. These required data are obtained from the model input weather data file. To calculate the aerodynamic resistance of the crop (ra) [s m-1] and the canopy resistance (rc) [s m-1] the crop height (cropheight) [m] and the LAI are needed. Both values are provided by the plant growth module. Potential evapotranspiration is divided into potential evaporation (Epot) [mm d-1] and potential transpiration (Tpot) [mm d-1]) plus interception (I) [mm d-1] according to the calculated amount of radiation reaching the soil surface relative to the total global radiation.\n\n\n\nThe soil water dynamics are simulated using a water content based solution of the Richards-equation. The soil is divided in different layers and for each layer the water content is calculated. Tpot as potential water uptake is distributed to the soil layers according to the root length density (RLD) [cm cm-3] in each layer. It is assumed, that the root length density decreases exponentially with soil depth (Kage, 2000). The depth growth of the roots is linearly calculated depending on Tsum and a parameter rd [cm d-1 °C], which describes the increase in rooting depth in relation to Tsum. rd was estimated using data presented by Brown and Biscoe (1985) and the measured water content values from experiment 1. The maximum rooting depth was assumed to be 150 cm. The root depth growth ceases at temperatures &lt; 3 °C. The actual water uptake from the soil layer is calculated from the potential uptake and a reduction function depending on the water content.\n\n\n\n\n\nWinter sugar beets can lose their leaves and petioles over winter due to frost, up to a total loss. According to an approach of Müller (2009), negative mean daily temperatures &lt;-2° C are summed up (TSmin) [°C]. The rate of shoot dry matter loss is estimated from the existing DMshoot, the changing rate of TSmin and a factor for dry matter decrease (LPL) [-].\n\\[\\frac {dL_{Shoot}}{dt}=DM_{Shoot} \\cdot \\frac{dTS_{min}}{dt} \\cdot LPL\\]\nThe dry matter loss rate is then used to calculate the change rate of DMshoot. The minimum value for DMshoot is 0.\n\\[\\frac{dDM_{Shoot}}{dt}=\\frac{dDM_{tot}}{dt}-\\frac{dDM_{root}}{dt}-\\frac{dL_{Shoot}}{dt}\\]\nA new initialization of the LAI is necessary, if DMleaf is 0. Therefore in spring an initial LAI of 0.025 is assumed if the temperature is &gt;Tb and LAI &lt; 0.025, simulating a regrowth from stored assimilates within the beet.\n\n\n\nVernalisation was estimated using a modification of the model of Milford et al. (2010). To be able to use daily weather data, the original model working on an hourly basis was converted to a daily basis with mean daily temperature. The daily vernalisation rate is calculated as a value between 0 and 1 depending on Tair (Fig. 1). The vernalisation values of each day are added until the sum required for fully vernalising the sugar beet was accomplished. Vernalising temperatures are commonly assumed to range between 1–12 °C with an optimum between 6–8° C (Jaggard et al., 1983; Milford et al., 2010). Data about the absolute vernalisation requirement of sugar beet are still scarce. In a climate chamber experiment with sugar beets, Mutasa-Göttgens et al. (2010) used a temperature regime of 8 °C for 9 days, 6–8 °C for the following 18 days and a 7-day thermal buffer period at 15 °C as vernalisation (all in one 32 days) whereas Crosthwaite and Jenkins (1993) proposed 6–11 °C with 8 hours of light for 3 month. Testing the vernalisation requirement of Beta vulgaris spp. maritima from different populations across France and Belgium Boudry et al. (2002) used 5–7 °C for 60 days to vernalise the beets. We assumed temperatures of 5–7 °C for 60 days to be sufficient to fully meet the vernalisation requirement of sugar beets.\n\n\n\nAs no non-bolting winter beet variety exists at present, it is assumed that the growing phase in autumn/winter can be simulated according to bolting winter beet. After reaching full vernalisation the beet follows the growth pattern of conventional sugar beet in spring."
